# Diabetes_predictor-

I recently developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on clinical data. This project involved the full workflow from data exploration to model evaluation, utilizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel.

Key Steps:
Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

Explored a diabetes dataset and standardized the features using StandardScaler.
Separated features and outcomes to prepare the data for modeling.
Model Development:

Trained an SVM classifier to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, ensuring balanced class distribution.
Evaluation & Prediction:

Achieved solid accuracy on both training and test sets, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness.
Implemented the model to predict diabetes on new data points, showcasing its practical application.
Outcome:
This project enhanced my skills in predictive modeling, particularly with SVM, and highlighted the potential of machine learning in healthcare. I’m looking forward to further optimizing the model and exploring deployment options.
